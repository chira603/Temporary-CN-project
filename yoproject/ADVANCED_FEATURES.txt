  * Record type (DNSKEY/DS/RRSIG)
  * Key tag (unique identifier)
  * Algorithm (RSASHA256)
  * Digest type (SHA256)

  * D3.js tree diagram showing trust hierarchy
  * Animated node reveal (root → TLD → authoritative)
  * Color-coded nodes:
    - Purple: Root (🔐)
    - Pink: TLD (🔑)
    - Red: Authoritative (✅)
  * Golden connecting lines with glow effect
  * Detail cards for each DNSSEC step

- DNSSEC Detail Cards:
  * Valid/Invalid status with color coding
  * Key information (tag, algorithm, expiration)
  * Error messages for failures
  * Hover effects and animations

- Security Score Display:
  * Animated pulsing circle (150px diameter)
  * Score out of 100
  * Gold gradient background
  * Status description (Excellent/Warning)

Configuration:
- Enable DNSSEC Validation (checkbox)
- Simulate DNSSEC Failure (checkbox, shown when DNSSEC enabled)

Integration:
- Automatically displayed when DNSSEC is enabled and steps contain DNSSEC data
- Positioned between VisualizationPanel and ResultsPanel
- Responsive design for mobile devices
